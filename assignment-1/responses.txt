The world wide web are the pages that are found online, and the internet is the network that the web lives within.
The internet moves data from one place to another. 
A directory is essentially the housing unit for files.
It is simple and easy to track changes. It is easy to revert back if I screw up. It's easy to share with my peers if I need help.
I took a screen shot and put it under the assignment-1, I'm not sure if that's what you're asking.
Currently my favorite form of art is screen-printing!
