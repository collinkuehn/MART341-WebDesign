  <li><b>TOFU PREP</b> Blot the tofu gently, and cut into 6 slices, then cut each slice into two, to make 12 strips. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Brush all sides liberally with the peanut sauce, spooning a little extra over the tops. Bake 25-30 minutes. Save the remaining sauce for the burritos.</li>

<li><b>COOK RICE:</b> The fastest way to make rice is using the pasta method. Boil <I>1/2 cup</I> rice in 4-5 cups salted water, uncovered, drain when tender, using a strainer, letting stand in the strainer 5 mins. Fluff.</li>

<li>Prep the veggies and herbs: cut and place them on a tray or plate with the peanut sauce.</li>

<li>Heat the refried beans, whisking in <I>2-4 tablespoons</I> water with a fork to loosen them. Add a spoonful of garlic chili paste, Sambal Olek, or a squirt of sriracha to taste, to pep them up a bit. Keep them warm.</li>

<li><b>Tortillas</b> Right before assembling the burritos, warm the tortillas to make them soft and pliable. If you have a gas stove,  use tongs, place directly on the gas grate, over medium flame, turning often with tongs. Otherwise, place in a single layer in the oven on the rack until soft and pliable. Wrap in a kitchen towel to keep warm.</li>


<li><b>Assemble:</b> Spoon some of the warm beans onto the tortilla creating a base, add rice, then tofu and veggies and herbs. Spoon some peanut sauce over top, and optional peanuts or peanut chili crunch, and wrap up. </li>
