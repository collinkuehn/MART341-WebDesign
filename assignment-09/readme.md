1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

-I'm hoping that these navigation links actually work once I put this on Github, I'll update this if they don't. I had a hard time with styling and figuring out how to do multiple style changes for one specific section. (Changing colors and aligning text for example, but I ended up figuring it out.)


UPDATE: Navigation did not work but I think I figured it out. Once again will update if not.
UPDATE 2: I don't know where I'm going wrong here. I've tried adding them to a folder to get the link directory. And that seemed to get rid of my images. I tried removing the .html in the nav link, that didn't work.
UPDATE 3: Putting the .html in a pages folder directs me to the readme when trying the link on Github.
UPDATE 500: I don't know what is going on.. When I click the links from the index site it will take me to the other pages, but when I click the links from the other sites, I get an error. I'm going to run out of time here so I'm going to submit it as is and email you for advice so I can at least go in and fix it tomorrow. 

2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

-Each week is getting more and more difficult, I already have a hard time remembering code and structure, but fortunately I have these past assignments to look back on and refresh. It's just a lot to remember, I don't know how people do this on large scale for a living. I don't think my brain functions that way!

3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to overcome your challenges?

-Really just what I already went over. I had some stylistic errors. I feel like this weeks code wasn't as clean looking as the weeks prior. It makes sense though I was feeling a little more overwhelmed and it kind of appears in the code itself. As for the web page itself I think I did an alright job. I liked going through all the different color options I could choose from.
