1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

-I'm hoping that these navigation links actually work once I put this on Github, I'll update this if they don't. I had a hard time with styling and figuring out how to do multiple style changes for one specific section. (Changing colors and aligning text for example, but I ended up figuring it out.)


UPDATE: Navigation did not work but I think I figured it out. Once again will update if not.

2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

-Each week is getting more and more difficult, I already have a hard time remembering code and structure, but fortunately I have these past assignments to look back on and refresh. It's just a lot to remember, I don't know how people do this on large scale for a living. I don't think my brain functions that way!

3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to overcome your challenges?
-Really just what I already went over. I had some stylistic errors. I feel like this weeks code wasn't as clean looking as the weeks prior. It makes sense though I was feeling a little more overwhelmed and it kind of appears in the code itself. As for the web page itself I think I did an alright job. I liked going through all the different color options I could choose from.
