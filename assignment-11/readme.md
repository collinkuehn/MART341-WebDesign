1. System Fonts are fonts that are already installed on a persons computer. Web Fonts are fonts that can be downloaded off the web, or imbedded from linking the font to the download site. Web-Safe fonts are a list of fonts that all computer platforms are guaranteed to understand and read properly.  

2. Since people use different operating systems and platforms, not everyone views the same fonts. If I used a font that was only available to windows users, and I went to view it on a Mac it wouldn't show up properly. When you stack fonts you have  fall back option, which will load up the font second in line.

3. I really struggled with this assignment, that's why it's late. I still don't understand how to link fonts in css from my self hosted directory. I got frustrated with it, I'm pretty sure it's not complete.
