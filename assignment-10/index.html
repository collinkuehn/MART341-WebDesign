    <h2> The Counter Culture</h2>
    <p> The counterculture of the 1960s was an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed throughout much of the Western world between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the U.S. Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and, with the expansion of the American Government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam, would later become revolutionary to some. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s.(Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s">Wikipedia)</a>

      <h2>The Grateful Dead</h2>

      <p>
        "The Grateful Dead’s influence can be felt in so many different facets of life. Their logos and imagery are still proudly displayed at many of the country’s biggest events, from Burning Man to Bonnaroo. Covers of their tunes are played from stadiums to backyard jam sessions. The Dead are synonymous with the Hippie movement and American counter-culture in a way that no other band has been. The Grateful Dead became more than just a band, they became an ideal."

"For better or worse, Jerry Garcia is an American folk-hero, his mythos as far-reaching as any tall-tale ever told. So, while he and his running buddies Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, and the rest of the band were flawed individuals, what they came to represent was a world just a little bit more beautiful than the one they were living in. They weren’t playing music and partying to save the world, they were just trying to make the burden a little less heavy. Judging by how many lives they have enlightened over more than five decades it’s safe to say they succeeded."

"They were a “working person’s” band that was never too good for their fanbase and because of how genuine they were, a community sprung up around them and their music. It’s the real kinship between Deadheads that has allowed the band to become more than entertainment. Parents pass the music down to their children like an heirloom and the children continue the tradition. How many bands have generations of fans following them around the country? None too many."
