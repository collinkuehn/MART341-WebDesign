1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
-The difference between span and div is that the span element is used for HTML inside a paragraph. Div elements are used to block elements together in larger chunks. They help provide structural clarity. Classes are an identifier that are used to group similar elements. ID elements are also identifiers, but they use unique names to describe that specific elements.

2. Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using a service like YouTube or
Vimeo to host your videos?
-The advantage of using services to host videos is that usually videos take up loads of space on sites and if you can use another source site you'll save capacity on your site. They can host large, high-quality versions of files. They also handle compatibility, encoding, and the other details necessary for the media to play on a variety of browsers, without any work from you. The disadvantages are you can get in trouble for potentially be reported for not having permission to use materials.

3. Free Response: What challenges did you have this week? How did you
overcome them?
-I really struggled this week at first. It took me a quite a few read overs and studying of the final source codes you used in the examples. Then I realized that I was just way over analyzing everything and it wasn't actually nearly as hard. At first I just was uncertain of what I was doing. This is dumb, but until I emailed you about finding the source images today I didn't realize there was that whole description section on moodle with the idea! and repository set-up. I've never scrolled down past the resources section and just get the instructions from downloading the week-8 pdf.
