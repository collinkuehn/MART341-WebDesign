Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
- My client was an imaginary screen printing studio that offered guidance and tutorials on how to screen print as well as hosting the service of in house designers and printers for those more interested in hiring to have work done.
Why is it important to consider a mobile-first design?
- In this day in age a majority of people view websites on their mobile devices. Computers aren't as portable as a cell phone so websites are predominately viewed from hand held devices. Because of this sizing and placement needs to be able to adapt to mobile viewing not just at home computers.

- Honestly I'm starting to drag my feet when it comes to this class. It's pretty useful, but my attention span to sit and figure all of this out is just not there. It's definitely getting harder and harder.. I kind of psych myself out going into assignments. It always seems like a lot to process and it is, but once I hit a stride things start coming together.
