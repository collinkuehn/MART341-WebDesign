Did you learn anything new about web development (i.e., using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
- I mean probably not anything that I hadn't already learned this semester. Overall as a whole, literally everything we did week by week was new to me, so that's been pretty cool.
Did you learn anything new about web design (i.e., using media, color, fonts)?
- I tried to keep my colors and design lay out pretty simple since I don't really know anything about HTML5 and making more advanced websites.

- It took me a while to figure out how to put photographs into rows and columns properly and I'm honestly not certain if I still did it right. I've viewed on multiple browsers and it looks a little different on each.
